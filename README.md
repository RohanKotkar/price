# Pune_house_price_prediction
# The goal of our project is to develop a machine learning model for predicting house prices. We are using supervised learning techniques to achieve this. Our main aim is to perform predictive analysis to estimate the price of houses based on specific features. 

# In this project, we will solve the problem of predicting house prices. We will consider various features of the house, such as its location, the area in square feet, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. By analyzing these factors, our model will predict the estimated price of the house. 

# We will gather data on these features and use it to train our model. This involves feeding the model examples of houses with known prices so it can learn the relationship between the features and the price. Once trained, the model will be able to predict the price of a new house based on its features.

# Our approach will include data collection, data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation. We will ensure that the data we use is clean and relevant, and we will choose the best algorithms for our model. After training the model, we will test its accuracy and make improvements if necessary.

# Overall, the objective of our project is to create a reliable and accurate machine learning model that can help predict house prices based on various features. This can be useful for potential homebuyers, real estate agents, and investors who want to estimate the value of a property.
